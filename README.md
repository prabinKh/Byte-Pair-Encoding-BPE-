## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language. This repository provides implementations of various NLP techniques using Python and popular NLP libraries.

## Key Concepts
### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of splitting text into smaller units called tokens (typically words or subwords). We demonstrate:
- Word tokenization
- Subword tokenization (Byte Pair Encoding)
- Sentence segmentation

### Stemming and Lemmatization
- **Stemming**: Reduces words to their root form by chopping off suffixes
- **Lemmatization**: Reduces words to their base form using vocabulary and grammar rules

### Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
POS tagging involves assigning parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence based on its definition and context.

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
NER identifies named entities in text such as names, organizations, locations, and dates.

### Data Cleaning for BPE
We demonstrate data cleaning techniques specifically for Byte Pair Encoding, including:
- Unicode normalization
- Contraction expansion
- Case sensitivity handling
- Noise removal (special characters, URLs, emails)
- Low-frequency word filtering

## Setup
To run the code examples, you'll need:
1. Python 3.6+
2. Required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install nltk spacy regex sentencepiece contractions
